# week2homework
This is a project which will help hold all of my information and projects of which I have worked on

Right now this is a work in project with only the first edits to it.

By the end of this class, this will be a fully developed website, that will help explain who I am and be visually appealing.

By the end of the class, I want this website to be almost completely changed from what I have submitted for homeowrk in the first couple of weeks.
